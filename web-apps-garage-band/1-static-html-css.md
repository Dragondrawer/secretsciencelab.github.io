# Jam session #1
"Web 1.0" 

In this session we go over how to make static web pages. I.e., what the web looked like in the 90s. 
We're going to take a trip down memory lane, starting with the early days of the internet. 
This will give you the basics and a good foundation. 
That way, you'll better understand and appreciate present-day tech when we get to it in a few sessions.
