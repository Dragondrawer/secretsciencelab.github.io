# Jam session #1
"Web 1.0" 

In this session we go over how to make static web pages. I.e., what the web looked like in the 90s. 
We're going to take a trip down memory lane, starting with the early days of the internet. 
This will give you the basics and a good foundation. 
That way, you'll better understand and appreciate present-day tech when we get to it in a few sessions.

### How to host your page live on the Internet (for free)
1. Make a Github account @ [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign in

2. Click to make a new repository:

3. Give the repository the special name `username.github.io` (where “username” is your GitHub user name):

  ![Set special repository name](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/create-new-repo-screen.png)
  
4. That's it! Now any page you put in this repository will appear online. 
    For example, if you put your `hello.html` page in your `your_username.github.io` repository, it will appear online @ `http://your_username.github.io/hello.html`
